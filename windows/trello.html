    <strong>Project Planning Tools</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    I’ve used a range of planning tools like Trello, Jira, and even Google Sheets to manage tasks, track progress, and keep teams aligned. I’m familiar with Agile principles and have applied them during group projects - organising work into sprints, prioritising deliverables, and doing regular check-ins or retros.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trello’s been my main tool for most uni and personal work. I usually set up boards with columns like to-do, in progress, testing, and done - and build each task around a clear user story to keep things focused and actionable.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve also used Jira for more structured workflows and sprint planning, and Notion for things like documentation, feature planning, and collaborative notes. Whatever the tool, the goal is always to stay organised, move fast, and make sure the team’s on the same page.
