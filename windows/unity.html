        <strong>Unity</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Unity is where most of my game development experience lives. I’ve used it across multiple uni projects and personal experiments, from 2D and 3D games to UI systems, controller support, and gameplay logic. I’m confident working with both the editor and C# scripting side-by-side, and I’m comfortable building complete scenes, menus, and systems from scratch.

        I’ve implemented player controllers, HUDs, cooldown indicators, and responsive menus with support for both keyboard and gamepad. I’ve also worked with things like ScriptableObjects, coroutines, animation states, input management, and general debugging tools within Unity.

        I enjoy making things feel good to play, like tightening up movement, making UI flow intuitively, or getting visual feedback just right. When something’s janky or off, I’m the one who goes in to fix it. Unity’s been the main engine I’ve worked in for years now, and it’s where I feel most at home creatively and technically.
