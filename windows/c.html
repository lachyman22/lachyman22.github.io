    <strong>C#</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Most of my exposure to C# has come through game development in
    <strong>Unity</strong>, where I’ve used it to build everything from basic
    prototypes to fully featured gameplay systems. It’s the language I’ve spent
    the most time with in a practical, hands on way.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    I’ve used C# to implement movement systems, combat logic, user interfaces,
    ability cooldowns, and input handling, including controller support and
    custom UI behaviours. I’m comfortable writing clean, event-driven code,
    working with Unity’s component model, and debugging through the Unity
    Editor.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    While I initially picked up C# through Unity scripting, over time I’ve
    become confident using it outside of that context too, including building
    small tools and experimenting with object-oriented patterns on the side.
