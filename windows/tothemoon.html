      <strong>To The Moon [2025]</strong>
    </h2>

      To the Moon is an animated short following a boy and his dog. As they gaze
      into the starry night sky, they’re filled with wonder and creativity,
      leading them to build a cardboard rocket from scraps in the garage. As
      their imagination takes over, they take off on their adventure into the
      stars, and they journey to the moon, experiencing the mysterious beauty of
      space. Back in reality, they sit and watch a real rocket soar across the
      sky, serving as a quiet reminder of how powerful a child’s imagination can
      be, and just how far it can take them.

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.2em">
      <li>
        Rocket Scene Design: Built and scripted the rocket assembly sequence
        using cardboard models and custom animations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Character Model Setup: Assigned textures and correcting rigging for the
        main character and dog models, ensuring they were ready for animation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Technical Animation: Wrote support scripts to handle object attachment,
        animation state triggers, and non-root motion character movement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scene Polish: Tweaked skybox, lighting, prop placement, and timing to
        improve visual consistency and flow.
