  <p>
    Python is my first and strongest language — I’ve been learning and using it since high school.
    Whether it’s scripting, automating tasks, building games, or working on university projects,
    Python has always been my go-to for getting things done quickly and cleanly.

  <p>
    Over the years, I’ve used it for data processing, prototyping, writing utility tools, and working with libraries and frameworks like
    <strong>pygame</strong>, <strong>pandas</strong>, and <strong>Django</strong>.
    If I’m tackling something new or unfamiliar, Python is usually the first tool I reach for.
