        <strong>Python</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Python is my first and strongest programming language, which i've been learning and using since high school. Whether it’s scripting, automating tasks, building games, or working on university projects, Python has always been my go-to for getting things done quickly.

        Over the years, I’ve used it for data processing, prototyping, writing utility tools, and working with libraries and frameworks like <strong>pygame</strong>, <strong>pandas</strong>, and <strong>Django</strong>. If I’m tackling something new or unfamiliar, Python is usually the first tool I reach for.
