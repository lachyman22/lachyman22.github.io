    <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    HTML and CSS have been essential tools in most of my web-based projects,
    especially when building personal sites and custom interfaces. I’ve used
    them heavily for layout structuring, responsive design, and recreating
    pixel-perfect visuals.

    Most recently, I’ve been working on this portfolio inspired by classic Mac
    OS UI! I’ve been using semantic HTML and modern CSS (including flexbox and
    grid) to build custom interactive layouts, dropdowns, dock effects, and
    animated elements without relying on heavy frameworks.

    While I tend to reach for utility libraries like
    <strong>Tailwind</strong> when needed, I’m also comfortable writing pure
    HTML/CSS from scratch, especially when I need tight control over look and
    feel or when building stylised experiences that break away from the standard
    template look.
