    <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    I’ve also worked with Unreal Engine for several projects and assignments.
    I’m comfortable navigating the editor, working with Blueprints, and building
    gameplay systems using Unreal’s built-in tools.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    I’ve used Unreal’s blueprint and actor systems with c++ to set up node-based
    pathfinding and behaviour trees for NPCs, including custom state machines
    for patrolling, chasing, and retreating. I’ve also worked with Niagara
    systems to create visual particle effects, from ambient particles to
    gameplay-triggered FX.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    I’m still building confidence in Unreal (and c++), but I have a solid grasp
    of the core systems, especially around AI, visual effects, and level setup,
    and I’m comfortable experimenting and learning as I go.
