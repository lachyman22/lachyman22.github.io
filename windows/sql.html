    <strong>SQL</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    I’ve used SQL across a few uni projects to work with structured data,
    including filtering, joining, and aggregating information from multiple
    tables. Most of my experience comes from tasks like exploring datasets,
    writing queries to extract insights, and preparing data for analysis.

  <p>
    I’m comfortable writing queries with JOINs, WHERE clauses, GROUP BY, and
    subqueries to extract necessary data when needed. While I haven’t built
    full-scale database systems yet, I know my way around querying and
    interpreting relational data when it counts.
