    <strong>Microsoft Office &amp; Google Drive</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    I’m proficient across both Microsoft Office and Google Drive suites - from
    writing reports and formatting documents in Word/Docs to building polished
    slides in PowerPoint/Slides. I use both regularly depending on the project
    or team setup.

  <p>
    Where I really shine is Excel and Google Sheets. I’ve used them extensively
    for data analysis, visualisation, planning, and automation. I’m confident
    with formulas, conditional formatting, charts, pivot tables, and data
    cleaning. I’ve also worked with scripting (Mainly VBA) for streamlining
    workflows.

  <p>
    Whether it’s working solo or collaborating in real-time, I know how to get
    the most out of these tools to stay organised, present clean data, and get
    stuff done efficiently.
